/**
 * Deprecated. This class, in conjunction with OperationConverter should only be used in /v1/operate and /v1/execute until removed.
 * The class was designed to convert maps in the format "{"operation": operation, "opValues":{...}}" to
 * the appropriate aerospike java client operation. Now that the rest gateway has been transitioned to use swagger docs
 * all the Operations need to be represented with a model so that its format can be auto documented. An added plus is improved
 * error messages and the ability to independently design the schema for each model i.e. no need for "operation" and "opValues" keys.
 * Class containing static methods used for converting Java Maps to Aerospike Operations.
